# It's MCT Group C!

Joni, Lindsay, Wenbo & Stephen are the inspiringly titled **MCT Group C**. Hailing from Hong Kong, India, China and Wales, they have backgrounds in everything from UX Design to audio engineering, music performance and printing multi-coloured giraffes on kids t-shirts. The plan for the next couple of years is to combine their diverse set of skills and knowledge in new, interesting and (hopefully) musical ways. MCT Group C are confident that this will involve copious amounts of cool new tech and making lots of strange beepy noises.

## Joni

Joni is a **user experience designer** and a **classical flautist** with a strong passion for finding solutions to wicked problems, such as finding ways to enhance the learning experience for cognitively 'not-so-fluent' people. She believes everyone is capable to learn and to create wonderful things that we only need to find different methods and styles that suit us.

Joining the MCT programme, she wants to explore the possibilities and limitations of how music or sound can create impact through the screens. Her research areas include HCI, Interface, User-Centred Design, Universal Design, Inclusive Design, Cognitive Psychology - Attention and Memory, and Neuro-Musicology.

Lindsay Charles is a **Multi-Instrumentalist** and an **Electrical & Electronics Engineer** from Hyderabad, India. Piano was his first instruments then moving into drums, guitars, bass and as curiosity grew, he studied the workings and crafting of instruments, their circuitry, technology and what not, compelling him to build his own MIDI Controller and other hardware attachments to the guitars.
From an artistic perspective, Lindsay composes background scores and soundscapes for documentaries and short films as a freelancer.
He loves playing bass in particularly funk, rock and jazz bands.
He's looking forward to acquire knowledge and practical experience to build his career through the MCT Program.
He also loves long mountain hikes. ;)

## Stephen

Stephen is a **programmer** and **musician** from Wales in the UK. He plays bass (both the guitar and the giant violin shaped one), and loves to spend evenings tucked away in his studio getting lost in a haze of swirling, synthesised dreaminess. He is a [business owner](https://www.noddlepod.com), and has spent over half his life living in other peoples countries. He also loves writing stories about underwater animals for his seven year old son, and has spent several years teaching SCUBA diving in south east Asia.

The MCT programme looks like it's going to be a gigantic playground for Stephen - there is so much of interest that he isn't quite sure of where to start. But it will probably involve building things, exploring new ways of performing live electronic music, and absorbing all that he can about communication, learning and pedagogy, as teaching is ultimately what he wants to do with his life.
